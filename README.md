# Express.js MVC Boilerplate (Practice Example 1)

This repository serves as a foundational template for building Node.js applications using the Express.js framework following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. It provides a structured and organized foundation for developing scalable and maintainable web applications.

## Features

Express.js Framework: Built on top of Express.js, a fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.

MVC Architecture: Follows the Model-View-Controller architectural pattern to separate concerns and improve code maintainability.

Routing: Define routes for handling various HTTP requests and mapping them to controller actions.
Controllers: Encapsulate application logic and handle incoming requests from the client.

Models: Represent data, business logic, and database interactions using models.

Views: Render dynamic content to the client using template engines like EJS, Pug, or Handlebars.

Error Handling: Centralized error handling to manage errors gracefully and maintain application stability.
